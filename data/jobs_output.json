We create the tools and resources our customers need to solve real-world challenges and transform industries, without massive infrastructure costs or the need to build large in-house AI/ML teams. Our employees work at the cutting edge of AI cloud infrastructure alongside some of the most experienced and innovative leaders and engineers in the field.Where we workHeadquartered in Amsterdam and listed on Nasdaq, Nebius has a global footprint with R&D hubs across Europe, North America, and Israel. The team of over 800 employees includes more than 400 highly skilled engineers with deep expertise across hardware and software engineering, as well as an in-house AI R&D team.AI Studio is a part ofNebius Cloud, one of the world’s largest GPU clouds, running tens of thousands of GPUs. We are building an inference platform that makes every kind of foundation model — text, vision, audio, and emerging multimodal architectures — fast, reliable, and effortless to deploy at massive scale. To keep pace with growing demand, we’re searching for engineers who want to craft world-class APIs and push the outer limits of latency, routing, and throughput.In this role you will design and implement the services that power inference for both internal and external customers. You’ll integrate and scale model back-ends, create sophisticated request-routing logic for high-throughput, low-latency workloads, and fortify our observability pipeline so the platform stays rock-solid as we charge toward the next growth leap. The work ranges from performance tuning and memory management to multi-tenant scheduling, with opportunities to hunt microseconds using CUDA, Triton, or other kernel-level profilers whenever the hardware demands it.We’re looking for developers who are fluent in Python, Go, or Rust; comfortable with asynchronous programming and distributed architectures; and practiced in API design, load balancing, caching, and queuing, all backed by clean, test-driven code and modern CI/CD. Familiarity with popular inference frameworks and back-ends (such as vLLM, sglang, or ComfyUI) and with orchestration stacks like Kubernetes, Ray, or FastAPI will help you hit the ground running. Equally important is a collaborative mindset: you communicate openly, enjoy working across disciplines, and like mentoring teammates as much as optimizing code paths. If shaping the infrastructure that powers tomorrow’s multimodal AI excites you, we’d love to hear from you.What we offerCompetitive salary and comprehensive benefits package.Opportunities for professional growth within Nebius.Hybrid working arrangements.A dynamic and collaborative work environment that values initiative and innovation.We’re growing and expanding our products every day.

    "description": "Web3 has created a new era of decentralised finance, democratising financial access. However, it has fallen short in generating mass consumer applications and remains largely centered around finance. We believe blockchain technology is a cornerstone for the future of new, open Internet applications.Today, there are limits to what you can build on-chain. Many factors constrain this, from the cost of running applications to the fundamental performance limitations of existing blockchains. We believe that new technologies can unlock a new class of real-time applications that normally must be built on Web2 foundations. Enabling these systems to be built on-chain will allow the free movement of businesses and users between online platforms, creating what we call a true virtual society.We are building Somnia, a fast and cost-effective EVM-based blockchain, to achieve this. Somnia is a layer-one blockchain with full EVM compatibility, capable of processing over 400,000 transactions per second with sub-second latency and low fees. This will unlock a new wave of on-chain applications. Initially, we are focusing on gaming, metaverse, and social experiences. But we are not even 100% certain of what can be built with the technology we are creating.Somnia is being developed byVirtual Society Foundation, an independent organisation initiated byImprobable, a British start-up that has been at the forefront of building virtual worlds for over a decade.

    "description": "Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.The company is founder led, profitable and growing.We have created a new career path at Canonical forPerformance Engineerswho bring exceptional clarity to software performance, correctness and efficiency. We are adding these roles to every engineering team at the company.As an open source platform, we have teams that work at every level of the software stack - from the kernel up through server and desktop applications, all the way to the web. We are adding roles with this focus in every engineering team in the company, to act asdrivers of performance engineering skills, tools, culture and insights to our entire product range. We have also created a central performance engineering team, where we will drive shared tools, dashboarding capabilities, measurement frameworks, analytical capabilities and skills. We call this career focus 'percorr' because we have found that the same deep insights that enable sophisticated performance measurement and design also enable teams to improve their harnesses and frameworks for correctness. Understanding not only the application, but the runtime, the compiler, and the system, all the way down to the CPU, gives an engineer the ability to think creatively and with insight about the right things to measure, and the right ways to verify correctness. We have found that performance engineers will often improve the deepest and trickiest areas of our test harnesses, and unblock their teams to test and measure previously 'dark' aspects of their work.We also have teams that work with every major silicon vendor and cloud, with a particular emphasis on performance optimisation of the entire stack for that architecture, CPU family or hypervisor. Our goal is to ensure that Ubuntu users can select whatever platform they want for their workloads and know they have access to the very best performance and efficiency across the entire stack from kernel to codec.If they wish, we will enable performance and correctness engineers to move between products every two years, so that they have the opportunity to raise the bar for performance in an array of products over time, and also that teams have the benefit of fresh eyes on their processes, thinking, harnesses, dashboards and code. Our performance and correctness leads are expected to betruly exceptional individuals, and also leaderswho are confident setting expectations of change, sharing insights and skills, running initiatives and programs.There is no way to move a meaningful codebase without also moving the people behind it.This is a career path for perfectionists and precision artists. Whether you have a particular language focus - C, C++, Rust, Golang, Python, Java, Flutter-Dart or others - or a particular love of the kernel or hardware or CPU instruction set, whether you see yourself as driving perceived user experience through performance or optimising the efficiency of data centers to reduce carbon footprint, this process is the best way to find a role at Canonical that speaks to your precision, rigour, insight and drive.Location: We have teams in every time zone, and can accommodate applications from almost any country.Nice-to-have skills we valueLow-level CPU insights and assembly language - understanding cache, registers, vectorization, memoryKernel performance insights - scheduling, context switching, hardware accelerationDistributed systems performance insights - tracing, debuggingCompiler level performance insights - profile guided optimization, inlining, assemblerRuntime performance insights - Golang, Python, JVM, NodeJSDatabase performance evaluation - plans, indexing, data modelling, tracing, monitoringWeb browser performance insights - JS, web frameworks, tracing, CSSPerformance measurement tooling - profiling, eBPF, D-Trace, flamegraphsBenchmarks and performance measurement tools - Phoronix Test Suite, othersTest harnesses and capabilities in C, C++, Rust, Python, Golang, NodeJS, JavaScriptThe role entailsDrive software performance and correctness in a specific projectCollaborate with colleagues and community around the globeWork on shared tools and infrastructure for performance measurement, analysis and reportingTeach, train and develop skills in your team for performance culture and designStrengthen test capabilities, harnesses and pipelinesAnalyze systems and code to understand performance and scalabilitySolve problems directly or through influence, leadership and skills developmentReview code and technical designsWhat we are looking for in youExceptional academic track record from both high school and universityUndergraduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or PhysicsDemonstrable personal initiatives to measure and improve performance, efficiency and correctness in codeConfidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitationTrack record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding resultsLeadership and commitment to skills development and mentorshipPassion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiativesThe work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleaguesProfessional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skillsExperience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountabilityAppreciative of diversity, polite and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organisationThoughtfulness and self-motivationResult-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitmentsAbility to travel internationally twice a year, for company events up to two weeks longWhat we offer colleaguesWe consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.
